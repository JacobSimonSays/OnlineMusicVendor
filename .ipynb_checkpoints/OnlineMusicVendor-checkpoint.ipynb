We'll instead base our analysis on the genre of each album. The four albums we have to choose from are Hip-Hop, Punk, Pop, and Blues.

However, the diffence between `Hip Hop/Rap` and `Pop` amounts to just two sales, hardly a convincing difference. Additionally, this data only tells us the total number of sales in each genre. It's possible that the company only sells more `Alternative & Punk` music because they have more of it available. If the company doesn't have many `Hip Hop/Rap` or `Pop` offerings, that could explain the lower sales. We should analyze the total number of tracks in each genre, and compare that to their respective sales. Below, we query our data to find the number of US sales per track available in each genre."

They'd like us to analyze how often customers purchase albums vs individual tracks. We need to sort each invoice into those that have every track from an album vs those that have only a few and those that have tracks from mulitple albums. The client indicated that their website does not allow customers to add tracks to purchases of whole albums, so we don't need to consider that scenario."

If protected file types are important to consumers, that could be used in the advertising of the online store.
